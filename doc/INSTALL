INSTALLATION
------------

Unpack the 'xclass-x.y.z.tar.gz' file (x.y.z is the version number):

   tar zxvf xclass-x.y.z.tar.gz

after this operation some directories will be created:

   xclass-x.y.z
     |
     +--config
     |
     +--doc                 -- contains some documentation files
     |
     +--icons               -- contains common icons used by the library
     |                         and some applications
     |
     +--include
     |    |
     |    +--xclass         -- contains the header files needed to compile 
     |                         the library and applications using the library
     +--lib
     |    |
     |    +--libxclass      -- contains the main library code
     |         |
     |         +--icons     -- contains some pixmaps used internally by xclass
     |
     +--example-app         -- contains an skeleton application you can use
     |                         as your starting point when creating a new
     |                         application
     |
     +--test                -- contains a few test programs.


To build a static version of the library, cd to the xclass-x.y.z directory
and type:

   ./configure
   make clean
   make
   make install

or, if you prefer to build a shared library instead:

   ./configure
   make clean
   make shared
   make install_shared

the last step (make install) is optional and should be done by the
superuser.

That's all concerning the library. You can now use it to build the
application packages available separatedly, or for writing your own apps.


CONFIG FILES
------------

During initialization, xclass searches for a configuration file containing
settings like colors, fonts and other miscellaneous stuff in the following
sequence:

 1.  $HOME/.xclassrc
 2.  $HOME/etc/xclassrc
 3.  /usr/local/xclass/etc/xclassrc

The first file found is used. If no configuration file was found, some
default values are used. That structure allows to have both system-wide and
user-level configuration files. Any user's configuration file would override
the system's one.

The installation process installs the system-wide startup file by default
in the /usr/local/xclass/etc directory. In addition, each user can have a
customized .xclassrc on its home directory.

Specific applications may need some other additional configuration files,
they would usually go to $HOME/.xclass/etc or /usr/local/xclass/etc

The format of the startup files is very similar to the well-known windows'
.ini files, i.e., they are divided into several named sections, under
which a list of option-value pairs is specified. Each named section is
identified with a header line, consisting of the section name enclosed in
square brackets []. The header is followed by the list of option-value
pairs, which are in the form "option = value", with only one option per
line allowed. Spaces at both sides of the equal sign are ignored.


PIXMAPS AND ICONS
-----------------

Many xclass applications make use of run-time loadable pixmaps and icons.
They usually rely on the proper setting of the 'icon dir' option of the
xclass configuration file.

The installation process copies all the icons supplied with xclass to
the /usr/local/xclass/icons directory, and the 'icon dir' option of the
default supplied xclassrc file points to it. Individual applications
might add some extra icons into that directory, or to put them somewhere
else, for example, in a directory under the user's account. In the last
case is up to the user to change accordingly his/her .xclassrc file
in order to add the new path to the 'icon dir' option. The 'icon dir'
option is found under the '[defaults]' section, and it may consist of
several paths separated by colons. Note that the current xclass version
does not allow environment variables to be specified in the path, so
things like $HOME/icons will not work.

Another way of specifying the icon path is through the OX_POOL environment
variable. As before, it may consist of several directory names separated
by colons, and its value overrides the configuration file settings.


MIME TYPES FILE
---------------

Some xclass widgets (like the file open dialog) need to use a special
mime-type file which defines actions and icons associated to certain file
types. 

As with the case of configuration files there way be system-wide and
user-level mime-type files. The system-wide file is usually in the
/usr/local/xclass/etc directory, the user's one should be put in
$HOME/.xclass/etc, the filename defaults to mime.types, but a different one
can be specified in the xclassrc file ('mime type file' option).

See the supplied MimeTypes.README file for details about the file format.


That's all.
Enjoy!
